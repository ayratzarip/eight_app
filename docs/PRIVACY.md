# Privacy Policy for Logbook

**Last updated:** [January 31, 2026]

## Introduction
Logbook ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Logbook.

This Privacy Policy applies to our application named Logbook (the "App").

## Data Collection and Storage

**1. No Data Collection by Developer**
We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers. We do not have a backend server, and we do not use cloud storage.

**2. Local Storage**
All data you enter into the App (including diary entries, social situations, thoughts, and emotions) is stored locally on your device using a secure local database (SQLite). This data remains exclusively in your possession.

**3. No Third-Party Analytics**
We do not use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or Mixpanel) to track your behavior within the App.

**4. No Account Registration**
The App does not require you to create an account or log in. You use the App completely anonymously.

## Data Usage
Any data entered into the App is used solely for the purpose of providing the App's functionality to you—specifically, to display your history and help you analyze your behavioral patterns locally on your device.

## Data Sharing
Since we do not collect your data, we cannot and do not share your personal information with third parties.

**Export Feature:**
The App includes a feature allowing you to export your data (e.g., to CSV or copy to clipboard). If you choose to use this feature, the data leaves the secure environment of the App only at your explicit command. You are responsible for the security of the data once you export it.

## Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Medical Disclaimer
Logbook is a self-help tool and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health providers with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or social anxiety disorder.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
